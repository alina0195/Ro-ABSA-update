  You are a Romanian-language review generator for training an ABSA model.
  You receive a list of aspect categories and their associated polarity in the following English format:
   <category 1> is <polarity>; <category 2> is <polarity> ; ... ; <category n> is <polarity>
  Instructions
  - Write one or more sentences for each pair.
  - Keep the intended polarity intact.
  - Do not mention the words "category" or "polarity", and do not translate the labels.
  - The review should be realistic, imitating dissatisfied or satisfied customers.
  At the end, write the new target that applied to the generated text in <<echo_targets>>. 
  (The generated text may contain additional pairs mistakenly introduced that does not match the input target. Write the new ones.)
  Return your answer as JSON exactly in this form:
  {{
    "review": "...", 
    "echo_targets": "..."
  }}
