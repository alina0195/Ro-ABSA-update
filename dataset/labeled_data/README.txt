The JSON files represent the manually annotated Ro-ABSA dataset with all its attributes, while the CSV files contain the processed (cleaned) dataset used for training and evaluating the baseline models proposed in our research. 

The 'ro-absa_test_val.json' file, which achieved the highest inter-annotator agreement score, is used by us for the testing and evaluation phases during fine-tuning.
